Halo, ~~I am~~ We are Back!

After 5 years with no update, we are back with a new face—but don't worry, you can still read all the old posts at [blog.crackatoa.id](https://blog.crackatoa.id/). This time around, we’re making it our mission to actively share fresh ideas, insights, and experiences more regularly.

We've missed connecting with you, and now we're excited to return, with even more passion for the things we love talking about. Whether it’s deep dives into tech, security, or just sharing what we’ve learned along the way, we want this blog to feel like a place where ideas flow freely and you feel right at home.

So, welcome back, and we hope you'll stick around for this new chapter!
